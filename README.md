# heaps-template

The template I'll use for starting games using the [Heaps](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps) game framework.

Project configuration mostly taken from [deepnight's gameBase](https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase).

## Getting started

```bash
haxe install.hxml
```

Then, build for a target platform:
- web: `haxe build.web.hxml`
- opengl w hashlink: `haxe build.opengl.hxml`
- directx w hashlink: `haxe build.directx.hxml`

Everything can be run from VS Code instead.
